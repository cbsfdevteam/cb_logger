# cb_Looger - Custom log framework
Salesforce logging tool powered by Platform Events and Big Objects.

A log based on Big Objects that is called from apex for a variety of log needs.<br/>
“SUCCESS”, “FAIL”, “LOG”, “CALLOUT_RETRY”, “EXCEPTION” and more….<br/>
In apex we can use the CB_Logger class and by calling a simple method to determine the log type, subject and body.<br/>
The log is initially a platform event which is added to a list of event logs, and we either publish immediately or at the end of the transaction (inside our trigger framework using a single call to the publish method per transaction).<br/>
Once the event is published, the event trigger picks it up and one at a time we convert them into big objects.<br/> At this point, we make sure to add a sequence number for each log in the list, because big objects can be considered duplicates and overwrite each other if the index fields are not unique.<br/>
The reason for publishing a platform event and not writing directly to the big object is because you cannot mix dml of sObjects with big objects.<br/> By creating a platform event, this starts a new transaction where we can commit the big objects without receiving such dml errors.<br/>
Once the objects are committed, we can then go to the logger UI, and filter by date, log type, or subject.<br/>
You can expand the message to view all the details, and if there is something that needs to be shared with a team member you can use the email button in the UI to choose the recipient from a pre-determined list (managed via custom label) and send them a copy.<br/>

Why we made this
-------------
We, the Salesforce developers team at Cellebrite, are working very hard to develop solutions and frameworks for our users (internal users and external customers). <br/>As you all know, Salesforce platform has evolved immensely in the past years, and continue to evolve and add new features with each release.<br/>
One issue we had issues with and didn’t evolve too much was logging.<br/>
Mainly answering these questions:<br/>
- What is happening in my org? Are the main business processes working without issues?
- Are there any errors?
- Who was the logged-in user?
- What record was being created/updated when it happened?
- Did our scheduled job finish?
- Did a callout was successful?
And many more

Apex logs are useful but you will need to activate a debug log for each user, there is a limit of 24 hours per activation and there is a limit on log file size. Moreover, you will need to be experienced in log reading to get value from it.

Enter our own “CB_Logger”.
